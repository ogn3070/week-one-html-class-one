<h2>Marc Muhywa Page!</h2>

<p>
  I always been curious about how things work especially 
  the apps and websites, I used every day. 
</p>

<p>
  Now, I'm decided to take the leap and become a programmer. <br>
  With no prior experience but a strong desire to learn, I dive
  into tutorials, exploring coding languages like <br> 
  Html, CSS, JavaScript, React Js, Python and Django and 
  joining online communities to stay inspired. <br>
  Each line of code I write feels like unlocking a new puzzle. 
  Though the path ahead may be challenging, <br> I am
  determined to build something meaningful and maybe 
  even change the world, one program at a time.
